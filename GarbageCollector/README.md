# code++ Garbage Collector
 Add Description...

# Building
The `make` script provided
assumes the GCC compiler, it may be substituted with other adequate compiler by adjusting the `make` script as needed.
Execute the make script, then run the
compiled executable.

If the code fails to compile, the execute won't be created or will remain the
last-compiled version. Adjust your code to resolve compiler errors and try again.

``` shell
$ ./make
$ ./compiled
```
